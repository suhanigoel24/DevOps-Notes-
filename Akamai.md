### 🔹 What Akamai Does

1. **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**
    
    - Akamai operates one of the largest CDNs in the world.
        
    - It has thousands of servers distributed across the globe.
        
    - When you visit a website (like Netflix, Airbnb, or even some banking apps), Akamai ensures the content is delivered to you from the **nearest server**, reducing latency and improving speed.
        
2. **Web & Application Security:**
    
    - Protects websites and apps from **DDoS attacks, bot attacks, and web vulnerabilities**.
        
    - Offers a Web Application Firewall (WAF), bot manager, and API security.
        
3. **Edge Computing & Performance:**
    
    - Provides services that allow computation and caching at the “edge” (closer to the user), reducing the load on origin servers.
        
    - Helps with things like **video streaming, software downloads, and gaming latency**.
        

### 🔹 Why Companies Use Akamai

- **Faster websites and apps** (less buffering, quicker page loads).
    
- **Better reliability** (content available even if origin servers are down).
    
- **Stronger security** (blocking malicious traffic before it reaches your servers).
    

### 🔹 Real-World Example

If you’re in India and visit a US-based website that uses Akamai, instead of fetching data all the way from the US, Akamai delivers it from a nearby Indian or Asian server. This makes the site load much faster.

👉 In short: Akamai is like a **traffic cop + bodyguard + speed booster** for the internet.

## What is a CDN?

A **CDN (Content Delivery Network)** is a globally distributed network of servers that helps deliver internet content (like web pages, images, videos, or software) to users **faster, more reliably, and more securely**.

### 🔹 How it Works (Simple Example)

- Without a CDN:  
    If a website is hosted on a single server in the US, a user in India has to fetch all data from that faraway server → slow, high latency.
    
- With a CDN:  
    The website’s content is cached (copied) on CDN servers around the world.  
    A user in India gets the content from the **nearest CDN server** (maybe in Delhi or Singapore) → fast, low latency.

### 🔹 Key Benefits of a CDN

1. **Speed** → Faster load times by reducing distance between user and server.
    
2. **Reliability** → If one server goes down, another nearby one takes over.
    
3. **Scalability** → Handles huge traffic spikes (e.g., Black Friday sales, live sports streaming).
    
4. **Security** → Protects against DDoS attacks, adds encryption, hides the origin server.

### 🔹 Real-World Uses

- **Video streaming platforms** (Netflix, YouTube) → Smooth playback, no buffering.
    
- **E-commerce websites** (Amazon, Flipkart) → Faster page load during heavy sales.
    
- **Gaming companies** → Quick game updates and low-latency play.
    
- **Software downloads** (Apple, Microsoft) → Faster and reliable delivery of updates.

👉 In short: A **CDN is like a network of “delivery hubs”** across the globe that make websites and apps faster, more reliable, and safer.
