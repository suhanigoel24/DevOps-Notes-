A **shell** is a **command-line interface (CLI)** program that allows users to interact with the **operating system kernel**.

- It **takes commands** from the user (like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`)
    
- Passes them to the **OS kernel** for execution
    
- Displays the **output** back to the user
    

So, you can think of it as a **bridge 🏗️ between the user and the operating system kernel**.

## **Types of Shells**

| 🏷 Shell Type                 | 📌 Description                                                                                                                         |

| **Bourne Shell (sh)**         | The original Unix shell (simple, no fancy features).                                                                                   |
| **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** | Most widely used shell in Linux 🐧. It extends `sh` with features like history, aliases, and scripting improvements.                   |
| **C Shell (csh)**             | Uses C-like syntax 🎭 (popular for users familiar with C language).                                                                    |
| **Korn Shell (ksh)**          | Combines features of Bourne and C Shell, used in enterprise Unix systems.                                                              |
| **Z Shell (zsh)**             | Extended version of Bash ⚡ — supports plugins, themes, autocompletion, and is very popular with developers (e.g., with **Oh My Zsh**). |
.**Summary**:

- **Shell** = CLI to talk to the OS kernel.
    
- **Bash** is the most common shell in Linux.
    
- Other shells exist depending on features or syntax preferences.
