### **Introduction**

- The instructor (Gaurav) introduces the video as a guide to **understanding and using Jenkins**.
    
- The focus is on creating a **Freestyle project** and running simple scripts.
    
- The video also mentions the importance of subscribing to the channel to follow along with future tutorials.

### **1. Dashboard Overview**

- Jenkins dashboard shows a **list of jobs** and their statuses.
    
- Each job can be clicked to see details.
    
- Freestyle projects vs pipeline projects:
    
    - **Freestyle project:** Basic project type, suitable for beginners.
        
    - **Pipeline project:** For more complex workflows (not the focus in this video).
        
- Beginners should start with **Freestyle projects** even if some options are unclear.

### **2. Creating a Freestyle Project**

- Click **“New Item”** on Jenkins dashboard.
    
- Enter a **project name**.
    
- Select **Freestyle project** and click **OK**.
    
- This sets up a simple job template.
    

---

### **3. Job Configuration**

- Inside the project, you can configure the **entire job**.
    
- The job can execute commands/scripts as part of its build process.
    
- Key points:
    
    - Do not get overwhelmed by all options initially; most come from **plugins**.
        
    - Focus on simple **Execute Shell** commands for learning.

### **4. Running a Simple Shell Script**

- Example given: **Hello World script**.
    
    - Navigate to the job → **Configure** → **Build** → **Execute Shell**.
        
    - Enter a simple command like `echo "Hello World"`.
        
- After saving, click **Build Now** to execute the job.
    
- Logs will show the output of the script, helping you understand execution.
    

---

### **5. Job Details**

- After execution, job details include:
    
    - Console output of the script.
        
    - Status of each build.
        
- You can navigate back to the dashboard to view multiple jobs and their results.

### **6. Jenkins User and Access**

- Jenkins automatically creates a **default user** during installation.
    
- Admin credentials are required to access Jenkins settings and configuration.
    
- Credentials and user details can be checked in:
    
    - `/var/lib/jenkins/secrets` (default location on server)
        
- This allows safe access to Jenkins settings and directories.
    

---

### **7. File and Directory Management**

- Jenkins stores scripts and job data in specific folders.
    
- For example, each project creates its own folder with build scripts inside.
    
- Navigating these directories helps in understanding where jobs and scripts are stored.
    

---

### **8. Output and Logging**

- Console logs are important for debugging and verifying script output.
    
- Example: When running `echo "Hello World"`, the console will display the output exactly as written.
    

---

### **9. Tips and Recommendations**

- Beginners should focus on **small steps**:
    
    - Start with Freestyle projects.
        
    - Use simple shell commands first.
        
    - Understand job execution and logs.
        
- Avoid trying to understand all features at once; they will become clearer over time.

### **10. Future Videos**

- Upcoming tutorials will cover:
    
    - Pipeline projects.
        
    - Advanced scripting.
        
    - More Jenkins features and integrations.
        

---

### **11. Summary**

- Jenkins is a powerful **automation server**.
    
- Starting with **Freestyle projects** is ideal for beginners.
    
- Jobs can execute scripts, and outputs are visible in logs.
    
- Default Jenkins user helps with administrative tasks.
    
- Project folders store scripts and job data.
    
- Keep experimenting with small commands to build confidence.

If you want, I can also make a **super concise diagram/flow of Jenkins workflow** from dashboard → job → shell execution → output — that makes it even easier to understand for beginners.

Do you want me to make that?
