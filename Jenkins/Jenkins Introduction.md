# Significance of DevOps in Software Development

## 1. Traditional Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

- **Steps in Classic SDLC**:
    
    1. **Planning/Design** – Decide what the application will do.
        
    2. **Development** – Write the code.
        
    3. **Testing** – Check if the app works as expected.
        
    4. **Deployment/Delivery** – Hand over the final app to the client.
        
- **Problems with this approach**:
    
    - Long cycle (e.g., 6 months to deliver one release).
        
    - If requirements change mid-way, a lot of rework is needed.
        
    - Client may not see progress until the end.
        
    - Bugs may appear only after going live.
        
    - Development and production environments behave differently.

## 2. Evolution Towards Agile/Incremental Development

- Instead of building everything at once, the software was broken into **small parts (iterations)**.
    
- Developers deliver features in chunks (e.g., every 15 days).
    
- Clients can review early and request changes sooner.
    
- Reduces risk of building the wrong product.

## 3. DevOps Introduction

- Still, another problem remained:  
    Code worked on the **developer’s machine** but often failed in **production**.
    
- To solve this, **DevOps methodology** emerged.
    

### What DevOps Brings:

- **Automation** of build, testing, and deployment.
    
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** – Every time a developer commits code, it is automatically built and tested.
    
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)** – After passing tests, code is deployed to staging or production.

## 4. DevOps Workflow with Jenkins (Example)

1. **Planning** – Define what to build.
    
2. **Coding** – Developer writes and commits code (e.g., to Git).
    
3. **Build** – As soon as code is committed, Jenkins creates a build.
    
    - If the build fails, developer gets a notification (email, Slack, etc.).
        
    - If the build succeeds, move to testing.
        
4. **Testing** – Automated tests run.
    
    - If tests fail → feedback to developer.
        
    - If tests pass → proceed to next stage.
        
5. **Deploy to Testing Server** – Code is deployed to a staging/test environment.
    
    - Manual or automated tests are run again.
        
6. **Approval** – Two possibilities:
    
    - **Manual approval** by a manager before pushing to production.
        
    - **Automated deployment** if all tests are passed successfully.
        
7. **Deploy to Production** – Application goes live.
    
8. **Monitoring** – The app is monitored in production for performance & errors.
    

This cycle repeats **every time new code is written**.

## 5. Tools in the Pipeline

- **Build Tools**: Maven, Gradle.
    
- **Testing Frameworks**: JUnit, etc.
    
- **Quality Checks**: Static code analysis tools.
    
- **Containerization**: Docker to create portable images.
    
- **Deployment**: Images deployed on servers/containers.
    
- **Jenkins Plugins**: Allow integration of these tools to automate the whole pipeline.

## 6. Key Idea

- DevOps = Collaboration + Automation.
    
- Ensures **faster delivery**, **continuous feedback**, and **more reliable software**.
    
- Turns the software cycle into a **continuous loop**:
    
    - Plan → Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor → Repeat.

 In short:  
Earlier, software was developed and tested in large chunks → slow and risky.  
With **DevOps**, the process is **automated, continuous, and iterative**, reducing bugs, improving speed, and keeping clients happy.
