### The Problem Without Roles

- Imagine you’re a sysadmin writing playbooks for many tasks:
    
    - Install Git
        
    - Install Tomcat
        
    - Manage users
        
    - Do patching (Java, Python upgrades)
        
    - Manage Jira
        
    - Server hardening
        
    - Vulnerability checks
        
- You could:
    
    - Put **everything in one big playbook** → very messy, hard to manage.
        
    - Or **separate playbooks per task** → still messy, because each might have templates, files, variables scattered around.  
        👉 Both options are hard to maintain and collaborate on.

### 🔹 What Roles Solve

- Roles = a **way to organize playbooks** into smaller, reusable, modular units.
    
- Each role = a **self-contained “package”** for a function (like “install git” or “configure Apache”).
    
- Benefits:
    
    - **Modular** – Break large playbooks into small reusable roles.
        
    - **Reusable** – Use roles across different projects.
        
    - **Version control friendly** – Easier for teams to collaborate.
        
    - **Separation of concerns** – Each team member can own a role (e.g., networking, databases).

### 🔹 Directory Structure of a Role

Every role has its own structure inside a `roles/` folder:

`roles/   myrole/     tasks/        → main.yml (the tasks)     vars/         → variables specific to this role     defaults/     → default variables (lowest priority)     handlers/     → handlers (notify/restart services)     templates/    → Jinja2 templates (.j2)     files/        → static files to copy     meta/         → role dependencies (info about other roles needed)`

👉 You don’t always need all folders. At minimum, you usually need:

- `tasks/main.yml`
    

---

### 🔹 Example

**Step 1: Create roles**  
Let’s say you want to:

- Install Git
    
- Install Apache (`httpd`)
    
- Install Telnet
    

Create a project folder:

`roles_example/   roles/     install_git/       tasks/         main.yml     install_httpd/       tasks/         main.yml     install_telnet/       tasks/         main.yml`

**main.yml for `install_git`:**

`- name: Install Git   package:     name: git     state: present`

**main.yml for `install_httpd`:**

`- name: Install Apache   package:     name: httpd     state: present`

**main.yml for `install_telnet`:**

`- name: Install Telnet   package:     name: telnet     state: present`

---

### 🔹 Main Playbook (to use roles)

Now, create a main playbook at project root, e.g. `install_packages.yml`:

`- name: Install all required packages   hosts: all   gather_facts: no    roles:     - install_git     - install_httpd     - install_telnet`

👉 When you run this playbook:

1. Ansible looks into `roles/`
    
2. Runs each role in order (Git → Apache → Telnet)
    

---

### 🔹 Collaboration Benefits

- Team members can **work independently**:
    
    - One person writes `install_git` role.
        
    - Another writes `install_httpd`.
        
    - Another writes `install_users`.
        
- Later, you can combine them in a single playbook just by listing roles.
    

---

# ✅ Summary

- Roles = a way to **organize playbooks better**.
    
- Each role has a **fixed folder structure** with `tasks/`, `vars/`, `templates/`, etc.
    
- Roles make code **modular, reusable, and easy to maintain**.
    
- In a project:
    
    - `roles/` folder → all your roles
        
    - Main playbook (`install_packages.yml`) → includes roles.

### Difference between multiple playbooks and roles

# 🔹 1. Combining Multiple Playbooks

### How it works:

- You write separate playbooks for different tasks.
    
- Then you combine them using either:
    
    - `import_playbook`
        
    - `include` (older syntax)
        

Example:

`# master.yml - import_playbook: install_git.yml - import_playbook: install_httpd.yml - import_playbook: install_telnet.yml`

👉 Each of those files (`install_git.yml`, `install_httpd.yml`, etc.) is a full playbook with `hosts`, `tasks`, `vars`, etc.

---

### Pros:

- Simple to understand.
    
- Each playbook is independent → you can run them separately.
    
- Useful when different playbooks are owned by different teams.
    

### Cons:

- Not very **modular** → each playbook may repeat the same structure (hosts, vars).
    
- Hard to **reuse** in other projects.
    
- File structure can get messy as the number of playbooks grows.
    
- Tasks, templates, vars, handlers are scattered → not bundled together.
    

---

# 🔹 2. Using Roles

### How it works:

- Instead of writing everything as full playbooks, you **organize tasks into roles** with a **standard folder structure**.
    
- Main playbook simply calls the role.
    

Example:

`# site.yml - hosts: all   roles:     - install_git     - install_httpd     - install_telnet`

👉 Now Ansible knows:

- Look inside `roles/install_git/tasks/main.yml`
    
- Then `roles/install_httpd/tasks/main.yml`
    
- Then `roles/install_telnet/tasks/main.yml`
    

---

### Pros:

- **Highly modular & reusable** → a role can be reused in multiple projects without modification.
    
- **Clean structure** → all files for a function (tasks, templates, vars, handlers) are in one place.
    
- **Collaboration-friendly** → multiple people can work on different roles.
    
- **Best practice** for larger projects.
    
- Many prebuilt roles exist on **Ansible Galaxy** (you can just download and use them).
    

### Cons:

- Slightly more setup/learning curve at first.
    
- For very small/simple automations, might feel like “extra structure”.

# 🔑 The Core Difference

|Feature|Combining Multiple Playbooks|Roles|
|---|---|---|
|**Organization**|Tasks spread across many playbooks|Tasks + vars + templates bundled inside role|
|**Reusability**|Playbooks are standalone|Roles are portable and reusable in any project|
|**Scalability**|Becomes messy with many playbooks|Designed for large, modular projects|
|**Best for**|Small/simple setups|Enterprise-level, reusable automation|

---

# 🎯 Analogy

- **Multiple Playbooks = Loose Notes**
    
    - Like having separate notebooks for math, science, history.
        
    - You can combine them, but notes are scattered.
        
- **Roles = Organized Folders**
    
    - Like having subject-wise folders with notes, assignments, references all together.
        
    - Easier to reuse and maintain.
        

---

✅ **In short:**

- If you just want to quickly automate 2–3 things → **combine playbooks**.
    
- If you want a clean, reusable, enterprise-ready structure → **use roles**.
  
  ### Technical Difference

|Aspect|Multiple Playbooks|Roles|
|---|---|---|
|**Organization**|Just separate YAML playbooks. No strict structure.|Strict directory structure (tasks, vars, templates, files, handlers).|
|**Reusability**|Reusing across projects = copy-paste playbook files.|Roles can be shared as packages (via **Ansible Galaxy** or Git).|
|**Maintenance**|Becomes messy as the number of playbooks grows.|Easier to maintain: everything about a component lives in one place.|
|**Collaboration**|Harder for teams (everyone edits big playbooks or many scattered files).|Each team member can own a role (e.g., DB team maintains `mysql` role).|
|**Dependencies**|No built-in way to say “this needs that.”|Roles can declare dependencies in `meta/`.|
|**Scalability**|Works for small projects.|Best for medium → large projects.|

---

✅ **So:**

- If you’re doing a quick automation → multiple playbooks are fine.
    
- If you’re building something that multiple people will use, reuse, and maintain → **roles are the professional way**.
